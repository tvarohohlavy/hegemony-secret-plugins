# hegemony-secret-vault

HashiCorp Vault secret backend plugin for Hegemony, packaged as an out-of-tree
wheel. It is discovered at runtime via the `hegemony.secret_backends`
entry-point group (`vault = "hegemony_secret_vault:register"`) and contributes
two backend type strings:

| Backend type | Display name | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| `vault` | HashiCorp Vault (KV v2) | Generic, preferred Vault KV v2 backend |
| `vault_kv2` | HashiCorp Vault (KV v2, legacy type) | Legacy alias of `vault` (same client); registered **hidden** — existing backends of this type keep working (the host's internal Vault backend uses it), but it no longer appears in the create-form type picker |

Both types build the same `VaultSecretsBackend`, which supports static token
auth (dev mode) and AppRole auth (production), with thread-safe token caching
and automatic re-authentication.

Secret backends are leaf components: unlike notification transports, the host
injects no services or context into a backend. The registered `factory`
receives only an already-resolved configuration dict and returns a backend
instance whose `read`/`write`/`test` methods talk directly to Vault.

This package depends only on [`hegemony-secret-sdk`](../../packages/secret_sdk)
and [`hvac`](https://pypi.org/project/hvac/) (the official HashiCorp Vault
client); it never imports Hegemony platform internals.

## Install

The wheel is **auto-installed** with the platform — it is already bundled in the
default Hegemony API and worker images, so no separate install step is needed
there. See the root [Install From A Release](../../README.md#install-from-a-release)
guide for Docker commands, checksum verification, and local-wheel development
installs if you need to install or upgrade it manually. Both the **API** (to
list/validate the backend type and resolve secrets) and the **worker** (to
resolve secrets at run time) need the wheel installed into `/opt/venv`; restart
both after installing so each registry reloads its entry points.

For local development against this repository:

```bash
uv pip install hegemony-secret-vault
```

## Configure

Create a secret backend of type `vault` pointing at your Vault server. The form
is schema-driven, so each field below is rendered automatically and
auth-material fields (`token`, `role_id`, `secret_id`, `role_id_file`,
`secret_id_file`, `api_role_id`, `api_secret_id`, `worker_role_id`,
`worker_secret_id`) get a secret/variable picker. The `api_*`/`worker_*` override fields carry an
`x_fallback_of` schema key naming the base field they override, so the host
form can show which value they inherit when left empty.

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `address` | yes | — | Vault server address, e.g. `http://vault:8200` |
| `kv_mount` | no | `hegemony` | KV mount point |
| `path_prefix` | no | — | Optional prefix applied to all secret paths |
| `token` | no | — | Static Vault token (dev mode). Takes precedence over AppRole |
| `role_id` / `secret_id` | no | — | AppRole credentials (production auth) |
| `role_id_file` / `secret_id_file` | no | — | Paths to files containing the AppRole role/secret ID, as an alternative to inline values |
| `api_role_id` / `api_secret_id` | no | — | Per-component AppRole override for the **API** process; remapped to `role_id`/`secret_id` before the client is built. Set these when the API and worker authenticate with different AppRoles |
| `worker_role_id` / `worker_secret_id` | no | — | Per-component AppRole override for the **worker** process; remapped to `role_id`/`secret_id` before the client is built. Set these when the API and worker authenticate with different AppRoles |
| `ca_cert_file` | no | — | Optional path to a CA certificate bundle for TLS verification |
| `verify_ssl` | no | `true` | Verify the TLS certificate |

Exactly one auth method must resolve: a static `token`, or an AppRole pair
(`role_id`/`role_id_file` plus `secret_id`/`secret_id_file`). Registering the
backend fails with a clear error if neither is configured. The `api_*`/`worker_*`
overrides are applied by the host before the backend factory runs, so from the
plugin's perspective the resolved config always uses the plain `role_id`/`secret_id`
keys.

Minimal config (dev mode, static token):

```json
{
  "address": "http://vault:8200",
  "token": "{{ env('VAULT_TOKEN') }}"
}
```

AppRole (production):

```json
{
  "address": "https://vault.example.com:8200",
  "kv_mount": "hegemony",
  "role_id": "{{ env('VAULT_ROLE_ID') }}",
  "secret_id": "{{ env('VAULT_SECRET_ID') }}"
}
```

## Usage

Once a `vault` (or legacy `vault_kv2`) backend is registered under a name
(the *scheme*, e.g. `vault`), reference secrets stored in it from any Hegemony
template field with:

```text
{{ secret('vault://orgs/default/secrets/db/password') }}
```

The portion after `scheme://` splits on the last `/`: everything before it is
the `path` passed to `read(path)` (here `orgs/default/secrets/db`, the KV
secret path under `kv_mount`), and the final segment is the `key` looked up in
the returned field mapping (here `password`). `write(path, data)` follows the
same path convention when secrets are managed through the Hegemony API rather
than directly in Vault.
